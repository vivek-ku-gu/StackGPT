How to Use the Folder Structure
Create the root folder (fastapi_app or any name you prefer).

Inside the root folder, create the static and templates folders.

Add the main.py file to the root folder.

Add the styles.css file to the static folder.

Add the HTML files (index.html, search.html, thread.html) to the templates folder.

Optionally, create a requirements.txt file to list dependencies.

Running the Application
Navigate to the root folder (fastapi_app) in your terminal.

Install dependencies (if you have a requirements.txt file):

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the FastAPI application:

bash
Copy
uvicorn main:app --reload
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the homepage.

This folder structure is clean, organized, and follows best practices for FastAPI applications. You can expand it further as your project grows (e.g., adding more static files, templates, or modularizing the code).
